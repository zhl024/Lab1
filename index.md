I am a third year student at **UCSD** pursuing degree in **Math-CS**. Motivated, hardworking and reliable fast learner. I am interested in **Game Design, Machine Learning, Human-computer Interaction and Data Science**. Pursuing opportunities to achieve advanced guidance in these fields. 

## Projects Done
- MIT advanced Machine Learning and Data Science Workshop led by Professor [Mark Vogelsberger](https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/mark-vogelsberger/).
    1. Project of building a basic communication agent using basic `NLP` algorithm (Python).
    2. Development of a user-interface that can diagnose cancer using `CNN` model (Python).
    3. Implementations of Logistic Regression and Random Forests (In Python, R, Julia).
- Project of learning patterns in Cytomegalovirus DNA; designing procedures for estimating the snow 
density from the gain reading on the snow gauge (In R).
- Implementation of Huffman-Compression (in C++).

## Project In Progress
The development of **FlapJS**, an online tool to build, simulate, and test automata and other formal models of computation. This student-built product is being piloted for use by CSE105 students. The Project is supervised by Professor [Mia Minnes](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~minnes/). And you can try the app out [here](https://flapjs.github.io/FLAPJS-WebApp/).
